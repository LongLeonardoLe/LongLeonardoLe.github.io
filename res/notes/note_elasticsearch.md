# ELASTICSEARCH
- search engine based on Lucene (an information retrieval software library)
- its magic is to be able to search by HTTP requests using keywork `_search` and extra flexibility and power using `query`
- provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON docs
	- scalable search
	- near real-time search
	- supports multitenancy
	- indices can be divided into shards, each shard can have 0/more replicas
	- each node hosts 1/more shards, acts as a coordinator to delegate ops to the correct shards
	- rebalancing and routing are done automatically
- supports facetiing and percolating - can be useful for notifying if new docs match for registered queries
- "gateway": handles long-term persistence of the index
